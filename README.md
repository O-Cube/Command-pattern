# Command-pattern
Sample demonstration of command pattern

#Description
- Application demondstrates a simple command pattern in c++
- WaterLevel, PressureLevel and TemperatureLevel classes implements the command interface which executes functions in the Process class
- the Process functionalities involve changing the values of water levels, pressure levels and temperature level variables.
- however these functions in the process class are not executed directly from the WaterLevel, PressureLevel and TemperatureLevel class, they are executed through an intermediary class called Controller
- this demonstrates the command pattern as every command is executed via the Controller class
- Controller can be made to store multiple commands in a a queue which can be executed sequentially

# Procedure
- clone application into local computer
- make -f Makefile to build the application
- make -f Makefile Run to execute the application
- make -f Makefile clean to delete object files and executable

  application output looks as follows:

  for setting water level = 30
              pressure level = 5
              temperature level = 1
# test procedure
- testing is performed using google test framework for c++, requires gtest and gmock packages
- also requires gcov, lcov and genhmtl packages
- navigate into test directory, run make -f Makefile to build the test application
- make -f Makefile Run to execute the test application

the following is a capture of the test application output

the line coverage as generated by lcov and genhtml is as thus:
